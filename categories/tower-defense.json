            "description": "Tower Defence is a strategy game where the player has to defend their territory from waves of enemy forces by building various defensive structures. The goal of the game is to stop the enemy forces from reaching the player's base, usually located at one end of the game map. The game typically features a top-down view of the game field and various pathways that the enemy forces follow. To prevent the enemy forces from passing through, the player must construct different types of defense structures along the pathways. These structures can include towers, walls, and traps that are designed to slow down or eliminate the enemy forces. Each defense structure has its own unique abilities and strengths, and players must strategically place them in a way that maximizes their effectiveness against the different types of enemy forces. As the game progresses, the enemy forces become more numerous and more powerful, and players must continually upgrade and improve their defense structures to keep up with the increasing difficulty. Players can earn in-game currency by defeating enemy forces, which they can then use to purchase and upgrade defense structures. Tower Defence games can be played in single-player mode or in multiplayer mode, where players can compete against each other to see who can defend their territory against the most waves of enemy forces. The genre has become increasingly popular over the years and has evolved to include a wide variety of different game mechanics, themes, and settings."
