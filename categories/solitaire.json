The game begins with the cards shuffled and dealt into seven tableau columns. The top card in each tableau column is face up, while the rest are face down.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this feat, players must employ a combination of cunning moves, careful stacking, and a keen eye for potential card sequences.

            "description": "Tripeaks Solitaire is an engaging and addictive puzzle game that offers two modes of play: Classic TriPeaks and 100 different Tripeaks levels. The objective of the game is to skillfully clear the tableau of all cards to achieve victory.\r\n\r\nIn Classic TriPeaks, players are presented with a pyramid-like tableau consisting of a mix of face-up and face-down cards. The open card at the bottom of the tableau sets the foundation for the game. To clear cards from the pyramid, players must strategically select cards that are either one rank higher or one rank lower in value than the open card. For instance, if the open card is a 7, players can remove any 6 or 8 from the tableau.\r\n\r\nThe challenge lies in making wise decisions and planning several moves ahead to clear as many cards as possible in a single turn. A well-thought-out strategy can lead to high scores and successful completion of the game.\r\n\r\nThroughout the game, players have access to a closed stack of cards that can be clicked on to reveal a new open card. This adds an element of unpredictability, requiring players to adapt their strategy based on the newly revealed card. It also introduces an element of luck, as the cards in the closed stack are shuffled and not visible to the player until revealed.\r\n\r\nAs players progress through the levels, the difficulty increases, with more complex card arrangements and challenging combinations to navigate. Successfully completing a level or achieving high scores often rewards players with in-game bonuses, encouraging them to strive for better performances and master the art of Tripeaks Solitaire.\r\n\r\nOverall, Tripeaks Solitaire provides an enjoyable and mentally stimulating gaming experience, combining elements of luck and strategy. Its straightforward rules make it accessible to players of all skill levels, while its ever-changing layouts and increasing difficulty ensure that the game remains fresh and exciting, offering hours of entertainment for puzzle enthusiasts."

            "description": "Pyramid Solitaire is a popular card game that challenges players to strategically remove cards from a pyramid-shaped arrangement. The objective of the game is to clear the entire pyramid by pairing up cards with a combined value of 13. \r\n\r\nIn this version of Pyramid Solitaire, the pyramid is constructed with a standard deck of 52 cards. The numerical cards (2-10) are valued according to their face value, while the Ace (A) is worth 1 point, the Jack (J) is worth 11 points, the Queen (Q) is worth 12 points, and the King (K) is worth 13 points.\r\n\r\nTo begin the game, the cards are shuffled and a pyramid is formed by dealing the cards face-up in a specific pattern. The pyramid consists of rows of cards, with each row containing a different number of cards. The first row has one card, the second row has two cards, the third row has three cards, and so on, until the final row with seven cards. The remaining cards are placed in a Draw pile.\r\n\r\nThe player's goal is to remove pairs of cards that have a combined value of 13. Cards can only be removed if they are completely exposed and not covered by any other cards. The King is a special card that can be removed on its own without needing a pair.\r\n\r\nTo make a pair and remove cards, the player selects two cards that meet the value criteria and click on them. If the total value of the two selected cards is 13, the pair is cleared from the pyramid. The removed cards are set aside, and any cards covering them become exposed and can be selected in future moves.\r\n\r\nIf no more pairs can be made or if the player wants to reveal a new card, they can draw a card from the Draw pile. The top card of the Draw pile is turned face-up, and the player can use it to create new pairs or to expose additional cards in the pyramid.\r\n\r\nThe game continues until all the cards in the pyramid have been cleared or until no more moves are possible. Success in Pyramid Solitaire is achieved by skillfully strategizing and maximizing the number of pairs cleared with each move, while being mindful of the available options in the pyramid and the remaining cards in the Draw pile.\r\n\r\nPyramid Solitaire provides an engaging and challenging gameplay experience, combining elements of strategy, decision-making, and a bit of luck. It is a game that rewards logical thinking and careful planning, making it a favorite choice for players seeking a stimulating and enjoyable card game."
