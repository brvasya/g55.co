Collecting these power-ups not only helps you navigate the levels more easily but also adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. Players must decide when and where to use these power-ups for maximum benefit, balancing the need to avoid obstacles with the desire to enhance their abilities.\r\n\r\nThe game also features a scoring system that rewards players for their performance. Points are awarded based on factors such as the speed at which you complete each level, the number of collectibles you gather, and how well you cooperate with your partner.
